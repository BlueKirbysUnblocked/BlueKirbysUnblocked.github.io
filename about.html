    <p style="color: white;">Hello, im BlueKirby and this is my website! I have some games here for you to download if you want them. <br> You do not have to worry about viruses because all of these games have been tested at <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url">virus total</a>. <br> And hey, if you want to make sure (i understand) you can go to the website itself and test them (make sure to extract the .zip file first, some of the checks get triggered if its in the zip)</p>
